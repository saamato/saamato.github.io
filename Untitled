  <h3>Solutions </h3>
  <p>Based on feedback across departments, we started to assess areas where we needed to improve.</p>


  <p class="label">More Personalization</p>

  <div class ="images"><img src="images/myForbes.png" class="forbes_current" alt="forbes image"><br><br>
    <img src="images/signedout.png" class="forbes_current" alt="forbes image"></div>
    <p>Forbes has an account center that personalizes content for you. We felt from the beginning that the account center should just be an extension of what a subscribed or known user sees on our homepage. For users who have an account and/or have a subscription, that information is shown "below the fold." When a user is not signed in, we serve them premium content and let them know if you want personalized content, you need to create an account. This allows us to continue to push engagement, personalization, and offer another entry point into content for the users.</p>

  <p class="label">Updated user experience</p>

  <div class ="images"><img src="images/Topics.png" class="forbes_current" alt="forbes image"></div>
  <p>Part of this redesign was to also make updates to the overall user experience. Currently on scroll, the Forbes homepage is monontous. We wanted to allow the editorial team to showcase stories in different layouts without blowing out images that don't warrant that much real estate. To increase value to each invidiual block, we also aligned our fonts as a brand. Instead of two fonts (a serif + san serif), we introduced a display font and a new serif font to complement it. This allowed us greater flexibility for our typographical treatment.</p>

<p class="label">Bigger story promotional blocks</p>

<div class ="images"><img src="images/Bills.png" class="forbes_current" alt="forbes image"><br>
  <img src="images/Promo.png" class="forbes_current" alt="forbes image">
</div>
<p> The current Forbes homepage only has two spots for the editorial team to manually curate content. This falls way short of the amount of content that Forbes produces on a daily basis. In addition to more editorial spots, we included multiple promotional options for Premium content, including the Forbes Lists. Each promotional block was designed to be a carousel if needed to include more content.</p>

<p class="label">Get the reader engaged </p>

<div class ="images">
  <img src="images/Interactivity.png" class="forbes_current" alt="forbes image">
</div>
<p>We understand that scrolling and just seeing the same items over and over again can be daunting to a reader. Across the organization we saw an uptick in CTR on areas where users can engage. We wanted an area where users can still learn from the news of the day, but also interact with it.</p>
