        <h2> Connect. Create. Collaborate. </h2>
        <p class = "type"> The cloud storage service market is a crowded one. But the demand for a functional and cheap cloud storage service is growing. Beespace is a place for people at various stages of busy-ness can connect, collaborate and create content. Beespace offers a broad range of plans as well, including a free plan with 15GB of storage.</p>

              <h3> What do our users want? </h3>
              <p>With the user survey, I wanted to get an idea of what people love, hate and want to improve about the cloud-based storage services they use. It was important for me to figure out why people used cloud-based storage. Was it for work? Was it personal? My other  point of focus was to figure out  what was the most and least important feature of the service.</p>

            <div class ="chart1">
              <h6>Why do users use cloud storage services?</h6>
              <p class="chart">I wanted to know if users use their storage service for personal or business. 60.7% said they used it for both while 3.7% said they use it for only business.</p>

              <p class="chart">Forget the frills. Half of the responses to the survey said the most important feature in their cloud-based storage service was uploading their own files.</p>

              <h3> What's the competition like? </h3>
              <p>As my knowledge grew about what users were looking for, I took a deep dive into the competition. I focused my analysis on Google Drive, Dropbox and iCloud. As I researched each cloud storage service, I noticed that they each offer a unique opportunity for the users.</p>

                              <p>Based on the information in my user survey as well as my research in the competitive analysis, I was able to create two user personas: the casual user and the professional. Both these user personas tap the markets I think Beespace needs to tap, those who just want to connect with their family and friends and those who want to create and collaborate.</p>

These users flows were for the high priority tasks such as onboarding, account upgrade and file upload. I used my research with the competitive analysis to determine what worked and what didn’t in the user flows.</p>

Once I had a refined version, I moved onto the other pages as I knew based on the user survey that I was going to try to keep this as simplistic as possible. </p>

                                  <p>When it came to defining what the cloud storage service would be, I thought back to the user survey and the user personas I created. I wanted the brand to be something people could trust and rely on. I wanted it to be a place where people went to stay organized and to stay connected. With the help of mindmapping, I played around the word combinations and landed on the word “busy.” I instantly thought of “bee” and went from there. It wasn’t long before Beespace was born. The refined Beespace logo is a honeycomb, with part of it cut out to make way for the hamburger style list and brand name. </p>

                                  <p>I created high fidelity prototypes of my design for both desktop and mobile that aligned with the brand styles I created. I made some adjustments to the style guide as I went along based on what worked and what didn’t during the usability testing.<p>

                                    <p>I put both mobile and desktop prototypes through a usability test. Both were extremely helpful in making the finishing touches to the products. The biggest area of confusion on mobile was that there weren’t enough back buttons and users had trouble navigating back to a screen. There was also some clarification that was needed on the sharing and adding a collaborator. For the most part, the adjustments I made from the first usability test were a success in the second round of testing. The feedback from the second round were small. I had screens disappear for sharing and adding a collaborating and users felt they were too fast or not necessary, so I nixed them in favor of users closing out of those dialog boxes themselves. I was able to use this feedback to fine tune my product.</p>

                                    <p>My original mockups were very clean. Not a lot of color and a lot of white space. But after the first usability test I thought maybe the design would better served with a rail that anchored the design better. Once I added the rail, I started to make a few adjustments on other pages to see if those would work well, too. I used three designs for preference tests to see if my original designs were more or less impactful. The victor in each of the tests are on the first of the two designs. </p>

                                  <p class="pt"> 86% of responses said they preferred the dashboard with the black rail. 14% said they preferred the clean look. I asked them why they chose that design: The majority of responses said they felt the rail anchored the page and provided necessary contrast. </p>

But rounded buttons are popular, so I asked users. 55% said they liked the square button and 45% said they liked the rounded. The results were not significant. I kept them square to maintain consistency. </p>

                                    <h3> Conclusion + what I learned </h3>
                                    <p>Beespace accomplishes its goal to give users a quick and clean experience in uploading, creating and sharing. Through many usability tests and design iterations, we developed a user interface that is simple to use, easy to navigate and provides a trustworthy experience. Without user testing, Beespace wouldn’t be what it is. The feedback provided during both tests proved crucial to making Beespace a success. </p>
                                    <br><br>
                                    <p>Designing Beespace was probably the most challenging thing I’ve designed. I have experience in visual design, but when it came to user research and branding, that’s not something I am familiar with. It’s natural for me to get lost in something I designed based on my own personal preferences. Designing Beespace forced me out of that box and it forced me to seek out users for input and thoughts. The user survey, user testing and preference testing were invaluable to this project. By the end of the project I felt more comfortable reaching out to others for opinions and it made me a much better designer.</p>
