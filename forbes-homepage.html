          <h3>  Overview</h3>
          <p>The Forbes Homepage is the front door to the business. This is true for ~2.7M monthly visitors and our advertisers. It had been 6 years since the last Forbes homepage redesign and since then both the business and competitive landscape have changed dramatically. It's necessary to update the homepage of Forbes to accurately reflect its new value propositions and create deeper engagement with site visitors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contentblock">
          <h3>What is the problem/opportunity?</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="contentblock_left">
          <p class="label">Problems:</p>
          <ul class="case">
            <li>Search is the most engaged with by users on the homepage vs other pages, demonstrating that they’re not seeing what they came for at Forbes</li>
            <li>The average scroll depth in 2023 was 17.38% (Mobile: 14.28%; Desktop: 22.18%). That means most people are never seeing the full breadth of Forbes if we’re showcasing it in a long scroll.</li>
            <li> Not enough news slots for editorial </li>
            <li> Lack of tentpole content that Forbes is known for </li>
            <li> Too much emphasis on imagery that is stock art and/or portraits </li>
            <li> Not enough dynamic content </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="contentblock_right">
          <p class="label">Opportunities:</p>
          <ul class="case">
            <li>Increase the 'above the fold' value to our site visitors</li>
            <li>Drive deeper engagement</li>
            <li>Surface more entry-points into our lines of business broadly.</li>
            <li>Surface opportunities for a personalized experience for known/modeled users</li>
            <li>Increase points of entry to Membership and Newsletters.</li>
            <li>Establish a more accurate representation of the breadth of the Forbes Universe.</li>
            <li>Increase visibility for our list franchises</li>
            <li>Create a framework to support consumer-focused content areas like Vetted, Advisor, Careers</li>
            <li>Establish visibility for events</li>
            <li>Improve content, channel, section/ topic discoverability</li>

          <br><br>
          <p> We took a less traditional approach to a competitve analysis. We knew what opportunities we had and where we fell short, but because the overall user experience of our homepage needed to be changed, we took a look at the competitors to see how they handled certain things (flexible layouts, scroll depth etc.) </p><br>
          <p>We had a lot of places to catch up (packaging stories and scroll depth issues), but we also had the ability to beat the competition with personalized content and leaning into dynamic content to engage the reader.</p>

        <div class="contentblock"><h3>Stakeholder interviews</h3>
          <p>We interviewed 40+ people across the organization including editorial, SEO, Sales, Forbes Vetted, Product Design, Growth, Ad operations, Live/Events, Engineering, and Executive Leadership. </p>
          <br>
          <h5>“Not a fan of our homepage, does a disservice to our journalism”</h5>
          <br><br>
          <h5>“It’s a little insane that we don’t showcase lists on the homepage”</h5>
          <br><br>
          <h5>“Homepage looks like a frontpage of an aggregated newspaper, not a magazine.”</h5>
          <br><br>

          <h4>Interview summary</h4>

          <h3>  Useberry Testing results</h3>
          <p>We gave 25 participants 15 seconds to take a look at Forbes.com. We told them to try to remember as much about their experience – from what they see to how they feel about the page.</p>

          <h4> What was this site?</h4>
          <p>72% (18) said it was Forbes<br>
            8% (2) said it was Business Insider<br>
            4% (1) said it was WSJ<br>
            16% (4) said it was none of the above.</p>

            <h4>What else do you remember from this webpage (images, text)?</h4>
            <p>A majority of responses said they remember the main image on the page and the breaking news bar. (the main story at the time was an exxon story and the image was a gas pump).</p>

            <h4>  How much of the website were you able to browse?</h4>
            <p>People were either confused by the cookies pop up (they could click out of it), others were able to only scroll down a little bit, about 15% of the way.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column1">
            <h4>What would you change about this page?</h4>

              <li>Lots of text</li>

              <li>Boring looking</li>

            <h5>"My attention and focus were pulled back and forth a lot — the top bar with the breaking news and maybe newly updated news (?) were a bit far and also a bit small, and hard to make sense of since the overflows were cut off with "...". I felt like I saw a jumble of words and definitely not something I can parse in 15 seconds."</h5>

          <div class="contentblock">
            <h3>Solutions </h3>
            <p>Based on feedback across departments, we started to assess areas where we needed to improve.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="contentblock">
            <p class="label">More Personalization</p>

            <div class ="images"><img src="images/myForbes.png" class="forbes_current" alt="forbes image"><br><br>
              <img src="images/signedout.png" class="forbes_current" alt="forbes image"></div>
              <p>Forbes has an account center that personalizes content for you. We felt from the beginning that the account center should just be an extension of what a subscribed or known user sees on our homepage. For users who have an account and/or have a subscription, that information is shown "below the fold." When a user is not signed in, we serve them premium content and let them know if you want personalized content, you need to create an account. This allows us to continue to push engagement, personalization, and offer another entry point into content for the users.
                <br>
                <br>
                Users who are not signed in will see a different homepage than users who are signed in and/or have an account. The differences are not stark, but there is significantly less personalization and the MyForbes section just becomes premium content.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="contentblock">
                <p class="label">Updated user experience</p>

                <div class ="images"><img src="images/Topics.png" class="forbes_current" alt="forbes image"></div>
                <p>Part of this redesign was to also make updates to the overall user experience. Currently on scroll, the Forbes homepage is monontous. We wanted to allow the editorial team to showcase stories in different layouts without blowing out images that don't warrant that much real estate. To increase value to each invidiual block, we also aligned our fonts as a brand. Instead of two fonts (a serif + san serif), we introduced a display font and a new serif font to complement it. This allowed us greater flexibility for our typographical treatment.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="contentblock">
                <p class="label">Bigger story promotional blocks</p><br>

                <div class ="images"><img src="images/Bills.png" class="forbes_current" alt="forbes image"><br>
                  <img src="images/Promo.png" class="forbes_current" alt="forbes image">
                </div>
                <p> The current Forbes homepage only has two spots for the editorial team to manually curate content. This falls way short of the amount of content that Forbes produces on a daily basis. In addition to more editorial spots, we included multiple promotional options for Premium content, including the Forbes Lists. Each promotional block was designed to be a carousel if needed to include more content.</p>
