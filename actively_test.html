        <h2> Exercise tracking made easy </h2>
        <p class = "type"> Tracking activity can be a helpful motivation. But as new apps enter the market with different capabilities, people tend to gravitate toward the one that they get the most out of. Actively is a fitness app that helps people stay motivated by tracking various exercise, connecting you with friends and strangers, breaking down stats and giving a fitness overview based on goals. </p>

                <p>Each fitness tracker offers different things. Some offer tracking for one exercise, while others offer tracking for multiple. Some offer all-day tracking and device syncs. But while some things work in some apps, it would be helpful to have a more comprehensive app for people who want to track their fitness.

                <p>Actively is focused on getting people moving. It combines aspects of some fitness tracking apps such as friends, comments, challenges, route-saving and live GPS tracker along with some basic fitness tracking apps that can track goals such as steps, calorie burn and exercise minutes. It’s easy to navigate so people of all fitness levels can use with ease.

              <p class="label">USER SURVEY</p>
              <h3> What do users want? </h3>
              <p>I wanted to gauge how people use fitness tracking apps. Not wearables, but apps that measure walking, hiking, biking, running and so on. I originally headed into this project hoping to create a running app. But I left the survey open to people who do more than run. It turns out people who even run a majority of the days of the week want MORE exercises in their app. So the app becomes more than just running and walking.</p>
            </section>

            <div class ="chart1">
              <h6>Do users run?</h6>
              <p class="chart">A majority of responses said they don't run. Which means they don't need an app specifically for tracking runs. This response changed the scope from a running app to a fitness app.</p>

            <div class="chart2">
              <h6>If they ran, did they track it with an app? </h6>
              <p class="chart">Yes. Those of who responded to the survey that they run all said they track their runs with an app. But they were all split about what makes their app good and what it needs to improve. </p>

              <h6>What do people who just exercise do? </h6>
              <p class="chart">I made the survey conditional and 50 percent of the people who said they don't run said they do track their exercises using an app. The needs and wants were similar to those who ran.</p>

              <h3> What's the competition like? </h3>
              <p>As my knowledge grew about what users were looking for, I took a deep dive into the competition. I focused on Strava, MapMyRun and Apple’s activity app. Each app offered something different, but each app really exceled in what they were offering. </p>

                                    <p> In previous projects, I felt as if I had rushed through the sketching process for my wireframes. This time around I was deliberate. I wanted to make sure things worked. I know that wireframes change. The Actively app did change based on logistics and user testing. But I was careful in the original process to try and get things close to how they would end up, with some flexibility of course. </p>

                                    <p>Defining what the app would be was probably the hardest part of this project. I struggled to find a name and even come up with a logo (the original flame was too close to the Tinder logo). The name came by chance. I was mindmapping and getting a little frustrated when I told someone that I was just sitting there, actively trying to come up with a name for my fitness app. The word actively stuck with me. The whole point of this app is to get people active, to get them actively conscious of the lifestyle choices they are making. The name made sense and it stuck.  </p>

                                      <h3> Conclusion + what I learned </h3>
                                      <p>I was honestly surprised I ended up making a fitness tracker. I went into it hoping to make a very focused running app. I had been running a lot and was getting by the different apps that I was using to track my runs. But when I took my survey to the people, their answers surprised me. It changed the scope of my project, and it did so without complaint from me. There are so many things I like about specific apps, and having all the great things from each app in one singular app could be really useful. </p><br><br>

                                      <p>As this was my second project, I was a little more aware of how users would and should interact with designs. But with that being said, I still missed a lot of things that the users found in tests. I need to reiterate this again, but users are really good at finding holes in designs. One of the things I noticed in the responses to the survey, was this sense of community that people who run or hike or bike want to feel. It was low on my user stories, and I included it in the prototype -- although it wasn’t clickable -- but I included sort of a challenges tab. </p><br><br>

                                      <p>With more time I would have liked to develop that -- where users can challenge each other and there are monthly challenges for all users. Motivating each other and yourself is such a big part of the app.</p>
